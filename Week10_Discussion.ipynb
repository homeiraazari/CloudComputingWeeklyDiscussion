        "The benefits of Google App Engine are endless. The mere purpose of Google App Engine is to enable users to build various web applications for a business leveraging Google's infrastructure. These applications make it easy for clients to develop, manage, and maintain as the data traffic and storage develops. Below are some advantages with Google App Engine:\n",
        "1. Infrastructure for Security -\n",
        "Application data and code are maintained in highly secure repositories, there is rarely any form of unauthorized access to date.\n",
        "2. Faster Time to Market -\n",
        "The most important thing for any company is to rapidly bring a product or service into the market. A company can achieve these goals with the help of Google's cloud app Engine.\n",
        "3. Quick to Start -\n",
        "It is possible to prototype and deploy applications within no time as there is no need of purchasing any product or hardware and maintain.\n",
        "4. Easy to Use -\n",
        "Google App Engine integrates the tools for designing, reviewing, releasing, and upgrading applications.\n",
        "5. Scalability -\n",
        "Scaling is one of the deciding factors for the success of any application. No matter how much number of users or data your app stores, the app engine will meet your needs by scaling up or down as needed.\n",
        "6. Cost Savings - clients can save money on other parts of their business, because they aren't responsible to manage servers on their own.\n",
